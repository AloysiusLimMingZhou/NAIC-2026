## 2. ⚙️ How to Run the Training Script

### 🔹Step 1: Clone the Dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AloysiusLimMingZhou/NAIC-2026.git
cd NAIC-2026
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Choose the correct notebook

| Notebook                           | Implementations                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `baseline_training.ipynb`          | Optimizers, LR Scheduler, EarlyStopping, Stratified 5-Fold, WeightedRandomSampler, CLAHE, Retina Cropping |
| `baseline_training_advanced.ipynb` | Everything above + Weighted Focal Loss (γ=2) + Three-Stage Fine-Tuning + Discriminative LR          |

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Install dependencies

Run Cell 1 in the notebook. Only run once as it'll be installed inside the VM OS boot disk and will not be removed even after server restart

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Download Dataset from Storage Bucket into Jupyter Server

Run **Cell 2** in the notebook, and it will download the dataset into the VM OS boot disk. This is to reduce Storage Bucket Read/Write cost and latency. Only run once or it'll re-download the 4939 dataset

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Run all cells

The pipeline will:

* Load dataset
* Apply CLAHE preprocessing & retina cropping
* Train model with Stratified 5-Fold + WeightedRandomSampler
* Save results into `/experiments/`

---

## 🤝 3. Teammate Model Assignments

Each teammate is assigned a strong model:

| Teammate                 | Model                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Yi Hui                   | ConvNext-Small                            |
| Aloysius                 | EfficientNet-B3                           |
| Additional (if got time) | EfficientNet-B4, Swin-TransformerV2-Small |

👉 You are also **free to explore other models** if you believe they perform better.

---

## 🧠 4. How to Change Model (Cell 8)

You need to change:

1. **Import**
2. **Model name in both `AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained()` and `<Import Name>.from_pretrained()`**

---

### 🔄 Model Conversion Table

| Model          | Import Name                          | <Import Name>.from_pretrained() & AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained() |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ConvNeXt V2    | `ConvNextForImageClassification`     | `"facebook/convnext-small-224"`                                        |
| EfficientNet   | `EfficientNetForImageClassification` | `"google/efficientnet-b3"`                                             |

---

### 🔧 Example (Swin V2)

```python
from transformers import SwinForImageClassification, AutoImageProcessor

model = SwinForImageClassification.from_pretrained(
    "facebook/convnext-small-224",
    num_labels=5
)

processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained('facebook/convnext-small-224')
```

**Note:** The model is loaded from **Huggingface**. If you want to explore other models or you think there's typo in the model name, please check out at https://huggingface.co/.

## 📊 5. Baseline Performance (You MUST Beat This)

| Metric        | Score  |
|---------------|--------|
| Accuracy      | 74.19% |
| Precision     | 69.13% |
| Recall        | 58.78% |
| F1 Score      | 59.95% |
| ROC_AUC Score | 78.91  |

---

👉 Your improved model should aim to:

> 🎯 **Increase Recall Score (most important metric)**\
> 🎯 **Increase Accuracy Score**\
> 🎯 **Ensure Both Recall & Precision are high (Lead to higher and balance F1 Score)**

## 🚀 6. Priority Ranking — What To Actually Implement First

Given GCP L4 GPU, ~4,939 images, competition timeline, here is the honest order of effort vs. reward:

| Priority | Action                                              | Why                                                     | Estimated F1 Gain |

## 🧾 7. Contribution Workflow

### 🔹 Step 1: Create your own branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/swinv2-improvement
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Train & Improve Model

* Run the notebook
* Results will be saved in `/experiments/`
* (Important) Only keep the best/final experiment results and delete the rest

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Create your own README

Inside your branch, add:

```
repo/
│
├── model.ipynb
├── README.md
├── experiments/              
│   └── exp_datetime/ (Best Version)
│       ├── metrics.json
│       ├── config.json
```

Your README should include:

* **Model used**

  * Improvements

---

## 8. All Experiment Logs Repository Strategy

We will follow a structure similar to **OpenAI parameter-golf style** (https://github.com/openai/parameter-golf):

---

### 📁 Records Folder (All Experiments)

```
records/
│
├── 2026-04-10_convnext_{strategy}/
├── 2026-04-12_efficientnet_{strategy}/
```

👉 Each PR adds a new experiment folder. This allows us to record and view all past experiments and discuss together the strategy.
